## KPI Definitions

### 8.1 Sales KPIs

```
Total Sales = SUM(Deal Amount)
              where Deal Status = "Won"

Win Rate = COUNT(Won Deals) / COUNT(Total Deals)
           × 100

Average Deal Size = SUM(Deal Amount) / COUNT(Deals)
```

### 8.2 Finance KPIs

```
Outstanding Amount = SUM(Invoice Amount) - SUM(Payment Amount)

Tax Summary = SUM(Tax Amount)
              by Tax Category

Revenue by Category = SUM(Amount) 
                      grouped by Product Category
```

### 8.3 Support KPIs

```
Average Resolution Time = AVG(Closed_Time - Created_Time)
                           (in hours or days)

Ticket Load = COUNT(Tickets) / COUNT(Customers)
              (per customer ratio)

SLA Compliance = COUNT(On-Time Tickets) / COUNT(Total Tickets)
                 × 100
```

### 8.4 Customer KPIs

```
Lifetime Value (LTV) = SUM(Revenue per Customer)
                       over chosen period
                       (MTD / QTD / YTD)

Customer Engagement Score = Function of:
  • Number of deals
  • Total revenue
  • Support interactions
  • Contract value
```

## Dashboard Validation

### 9.1 Data Accuracy Checks ✅

- [ ] Validate dashboard totals against reconciliation report (record counts and financial totals)
- [ ] Validate row counts against source systems (CRM, Books, Desk)
- [ ] Verify date format compliance (ISO: `YYYY-MM-DD`)
- [ ] Verify currency format (decimals to 2 places minimum)
- [ ] Ensure ETL staging tables include audit fields:
  - `source_id` — original PK from source
  - `source_updated_at` — source timestamp
  - `etl_run_id` — ETL execution ID
  - `etl_status` — success/skipped/corrected

### 9.2 Functional Checks ✅

- [ ] Filter behavior — verify filters apply across all charts consistently
- [ ] Drill-down functionality — ensure drill paths return correct records
- [ ] Cross-module linking — verify account → deal → invoice → ticket paths work
- [ ] Null value handling — confirm missing data is displayed appropriately

### 9.3 Performance Checks ⚡

- [ ] Dashboard load time — target **< 5 seconds** for key views
- [ ] Query optimization — add indexes where needed
- [ ] Cache refresh validation — verify cache invalidation aligns with data refresh
- [ ] Monitor concurrent user load

### 9.4 Evidence & Test Artifacts 📋

Maintain a **validation log** with:
- Test case ID
- Expected result
- Observed result
- Tester name
- Timestamp
- Screenshots/snapshots

## Appendix

### 11.1 Recommended ETL Audit Fields

| Field | Type | Purpose |
|-------|------|---------|
| `source_id` | VARCHAR | Original PK from source system |

### 11.2 Validation Checklist (Sample)

1. **Record Count Reconciliation**
   - [ ] Compare CRM deal count with dashboard
   - [ ] Compare Books invoice count with dashboard
   - [ ] Compare Desk ticket count with dashboard

2. **Financial Validation**
   - [ ] Validate top 10 invoices by amount
   - [ ] Reconcile total revenue (Deals vs. Books)
   - [ ] Compare outstanding amounts with aging report

3. **Sample Testing**
   - [ ] Select 50 random deals
   - [ ] Verify related account and invoice links
   - [ ] Check all drill-down paths from each dashboard

4. **User Acceptance**
   - [ ] Test filter interactions for each dashboard
   - [ ] Verify drill-down returns expected records
   - [ ] Confirm KPI calculations match business rules

### 11.3 Common Issues & Solutions

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Dashboard loads slowly | Add pre-aggregated staging table; check query complexity |
| Filters not applying | Verify join relationships; test filter column names |
| Mismatched totals | Check ETL deduplication logic; review null handling |
| Outdated data | Verify ETL scheduler is running; check API quotas |
